# Improve-Call-Center-Effectiveness-Using-Machine-Learning
The project aims to build a machine-learning model for a Call center to understand the call's sentiment by analyzing the employees' facial expressions and the Customer's tone, thus providing real-time suggestions on the screen to improve the overall call efficiency and offer better customer experience. Two Convolutional Neural network models were built using Image and Speech emotion recognition algorithms. The results from these models were combined to make the appropriate choice of providing suggestions to improve the overall call effectiveness
